# Python Programs

This repository contains several Python programs that perform basic tasks such as summing numbers, converting weight, extracting account IDs from an ARN, and reversing a word.

## 1. This program asks the user to enter two numbers: an integer and a float. It then calculates and displays the sum of those two numbers.

## 2. This program converts body weight from pounds to kilograms. The conversion factor used is 1 lb = 0.433992 kg, and the result is rounded to three decimal places.

## 3. This program extracts the account ID from a given AWS ARN string. It uses the split() function to parse the ARN and extract the account ID, which is the 5th part of the ARN string.

## 4. This program takes a word from the user and displays both the original word and the reversed version. It uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the string.
